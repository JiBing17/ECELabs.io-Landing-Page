# ECELabs.io Landing Page

This repository contains the codebase for the landing page that I have created for the ECELabs.io website. Initially developed during the Fall 2024 semester as part of the VIP (Vertically Integrated Projects) program at Purdue University, this project showcases my primary contribution to the team. Over time, I have continued to add more to this landing page to improve its functionality and presentation.
The original purpose of this project was to provide a modern, user-friendly landing page for the ECELabs.io platform to attract a wider audience. 

## Description

- **HTML** for structure and content

## Features
