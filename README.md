# ECELabs.io Website Prototype

This repository contains the codebase for the prototype of the ECELabs.io website. Initially developed during the Fall 2024 semester as part of the VIP (Vertically Integrated Projects) program at Purdue University, this project served as my primary contribution to the course. Over time, I have continued to refine and enhance the site to improve its functionality and presentation.

## Description

The ECELabs.io website was built from the ground up using standard web technologies:  
- **HTML** for structure and content  
- **CSS** for layout and design  
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and functionality

The original purpose of this project was to provide a modern, user-friendly interface for the ECELabs.io platform. My responsibilities included crafting the websiteâ€™s structure, styling the user interface, and implementing basic interactivity. After completing the initial version as part of my coursework, I have continued to update and upgrade the project, adding new features and optimizing the design.

## Features
- **Responsive design:** The layout adjusts gracefully for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
- **Interactive elements:** Enhanced user experience through JavaScript-driven functionality.  
- **Modern aesthetics:** Clean, professional visual design utilizing current best practices in web development.
